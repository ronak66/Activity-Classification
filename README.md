# Activity-Classification

Using the concepts of signal processing, machine learning and neural networks trying to predict the motor activity (running,walking,jumping,climbing) of an individual using data collected by accelerometer and gyroscope.  
Accelerometer and Gyroscope values are obtained from the sensors in your phone.
